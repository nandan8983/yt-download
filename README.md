# INTRODUCTION : 
  In this project, we will download videos from Youtube . User can paste any link from the Youtube and can download videos in excellent resolution
We will interface with one link input at one time. User will have to paste the link in given interface. Then it will request to the server of Google for given short link then youtube server will respond with HTML webpage and it will be converted into download source which will be downloaded in  MP4 format at excellent quality .
	Here we are using java program  to take link from the user. This  is capable of downloading videos from YouTube. What this does is, it sends an HTTP request to the YouTube Server using the video ID. In response, the server returns video info. The video info contains the URL to download the video.
In this program, we will learn how to request HTML server platform using java. In this program, we will use the PrintWriter i.e. formatted representations of objects to a text-output stream. 
We will also use Class InputStream and OutputStream. They both represent abstract class which is the superclass of all classes representing an input stream of bytes and output streams of bytes.
